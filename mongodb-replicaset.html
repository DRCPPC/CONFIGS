  <h1>MongoDB Replica set on ubuntu 20.04</h1>
  <p>
    MongoDB handles replication through an implementation called <em>replica sets</em>. Each running instance of
    MongoDB that’s part of a given replica set is referred to as one of its <b>members</b>. Every replica set must have
    one primary member and at least one secondary member.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h2>What is a replica set?</h2>
    <p>
      A replica set is a group of one or more members that are all configured to replicate with each other. Replica sets
      are used to provide high availability for your data. If a primary member fails, the replica set will automatically
      elect a new primary member. The new primary member will then notify the other members of the failure, and they
      will
      all attempt to become primary members themselves. This process can take a few minutes, and the replica set will
      keep
      trying to find a new primary member until one is found.
    </p>

    <h3>To complete this guide, you will need:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Three servers, each running Ubuntu 20.04. All three of these servers should have a non-root administrative user
        and a firewall configured with UFW. To set this up, follow our initial server setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04.
      </li>
      <li>
        MongoDB installed on each of your Ubuntu servers. To this end, follow our tutorial on How To Install MongoDB on
        Ubuntu 20.04, making sure to complete each step on all three of your servers.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 id="step-1">
      Step 1 — Configuring DNS Resolution
    </h2>
    <p>
      When it comes time to initialize your replica set in <a href="#step-4">Step 4</a>, you’ll need to provide an
      address
      where each replica set member can be reached by the other two in the set. The MongoDB documentation recommends
      against using IP addresses when configuring a replica set, since IP addresses can change unexpectedly. Instead,
      MongoDB recommends using logical DNS hostnames when configuring replica sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      hosts is a special file that allows you to assign human-readable hostnames to numerical IP addresses. This means
      that if the IP address of any of your servers ever changes, you’ll only have to update the hosts file on the three
      servers instead of reconfiguring the replica set.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Linux and other Unix-like systems, hosts is stored in the /etc/ directory. On each of your three servers, edit
      the file with your preferred text editor. Here, we’ll use nano:
      <br>
      <code>$ nano /etc/hosts</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first few lines which configure the localhost, add an entry for each member of the replica set. These
      entries take the form of an IP address followed by the human-readable name of your choice, as in this example:
      <em class="highlight">IP_address any_hostname</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure your servers to use whatever hostname you’d like, but it can be helpful to make each hostname
      descriptive. In examples throughout this guide, the three servers will use these hostnames:
    <ul>
      <li>mongo0.replset.member</li>
      <li>mongo1.replset.member</li>
      <li>mongo2.replset.member</li>
    </ul>
    Using these hostnames, your /etc/hosts files would look similar to the following highlighted lines:
    <code>
<pre>
127.0.0.1   localhost
10.0.0.0    mongo0.replset.member
10.0.0.1    mongo1.replset.member
10.0.0.2    mongo2.replset.member
</pre>
      </code>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="step-2">Step 2 — Updating Each Server’s Firewall Configurations with UFW</h2>

  <p>
    <em>This step can be handle with security group in aws hostting service </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Assuming you followed the prerequisite initial server setup guide you will have set up a firewall on each of the
    servers on which you’ve installed MongoDB and enabled access for the OpenSSH UFW profile. This is an important
    security measure, as these firewalls currently block connections to any port on your servers, save for ssh
    connections that present keys which align with those in each server’s respective authorized_keys file.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, these firewalls will also block the MongoDB instances on each server from communicating with one another,
    preventing you from initiating the replica set. To correct this, you’ll need to add new firewall rules to allow each
    server access to the port on the other two servers on which MongoDB is listening for connections.
  </p>

  <p>
    On mongo0, run the following ufw command to allow mongo1 access to port 27017 on mongo0:
    <code>
    $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo1_server_ip</b> to any port 27017
  </code>
    <br>
    Be sure to change mogno1_server_ip to reflect your mongo1 server’s actual IP address. Note that ufw commands will
    not
    work with hostnames configured in the hosts file, so be sure to use your servers’ actual IP addresses in this
    command
    and the following ones. Also, if you’ve updated the Mongo instance on this server to use a non-default port, be sure
    to change 27017 to reflect the port that your MongoDB instance is actually using. Then add another firewall rule to
    give mongo2 access to the same port:
    <code>
      $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo2_server_ip</b> to any port 27017
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, update the firewall rules for your other two servers. Run the following commands on mongo1, making sure to
    change
    the IP addresses to reflect those of mongo0 and mongo2, respectively:
    <code>
      $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo0_server_ip</b> to any port 27017
      <br>
      $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo2_server_ip</b> to any port 27017
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, run these two commands on mongo2. Again, be sure that you enter the correct IP addresses for each server:
    <code>
      $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo0_server_ip</b> to any port 27017 <br>
      $ sudo ufw allow from <b>mongo1_server_ip</b> to any port 27017
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    After adding these UFW rules, each of your three MongoDB servers will be allowed to access the port used by MongoDB
    on the other two servers. <br> However, you won’t be able to test this yet, since the Mongo instance on each server
    is currently blocking any external connections. After you enable replication by updating each MongoDB instance’s
    configuration file in the next step, you will be able to perform this test.
  </p>

  <h2 id="step-3">Step 3 — Enabling Replication in Each Server’s MongoDB Configuration File</h2>

  <p>
    At this point, you’ve edited your servers’ <em class="highlight">/etc/hosts</em> files to configure hostnames which
    will resolve to each one’s
    IP address. You’ve also opened up each of your servers’ firewalls to allow the other two servers access to the
    default MongoDB port, 27017. Now you’re ready to begin configuring the MongoDB installation on each server to enable
    replication.
  </p>

  <p>
    This step outlines how to do this by editing MongoDB’s configuration file, <em
      class="highlight">/etc/mongod.conf</em>. You must complete every
    procedure in this step on each server, but for demonstration purposes we will use mongo0 in examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    On mongo0, open the MongoDB configuration file in your preferred text editor:
    <code>
    $ sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
  </code>
    Even though you’ve opened up each server’s firewall to allow the other servers access to port 27017, MongoDB is
    currently bound to 127.0.0.1, the local loopback network interface. This means that MongoDB is only able to accept
    connections that originate on the server where it’s installed.
  </p>

  <p>
    To allow remote connections, you must bind MongoDB to your servers’ publicly-routable IP addresses in addition to
    127.0.0.1. This way, your MongoDB installation will be able to listen to connections made to your MongoDB server
    from remote machines.
    <br>
    Find the network interfaces section. It will look like this by default:
    <code>
<pre>
# network interfaces
net:
  port:   27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
</pre>
</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Append a comma to the line beginning with bindIp: followed by mongo0’s hostname or public IP address. This example
    uses the hostname configured in <a href="step-1">Step 1</a>:
    <code>
<pre>
# network interfaces
net:
  port:   27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1,mongo0.replset.member
</pre>
  </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, find the line that reads #replication: towards the bottom of the file. It will look like this:
    <code>
    <pre>
#replication:
    </pre>
  </code>
    Uncomment this line, then add a <b>replSetName</b> directive below this line followed by a name which MongoDB will
    use to identify the replica set:
    <code>
    <pre>
replication:
  replSetName: "rs0"
    </pre>
  </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this example, the <b>replSetName</b> directive’s value is <i>"rs0"</i>. You can provide whatever name you’d like
    here, but it can be helpful to use a descriptive name. Keep in mind, though, that each server’s mongod.conf file
    must have the same name after the replSetName directive in order for each of their MongoDB instances to become
    members of the same replica set.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that there are two spaces before the replSetName directive and that the name is wrapped in quotation marks,
    both
    of
    which are necessary for this configuration to be read properly.
    <br>
    After updating these two sections of the file, net and replication, they will look like this:
    <code>
    <pre>
# network interfaces
net:
  port:         27017
  bindIp:       127.0.0.1,mongo0.replset.member

replication:
  replSetName:  "rs0"
    </pre>
  </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Save and close the file. Then make these same changes to the /etc/mongod.conf files on mongo1 and mongo2. After
    doing
    so, these updated sections will look like this in mongo1’s configuration file
  </p>
  <p>
    After making these changes to each server’s mongod.conf file, save and close each file. Then, restart the mongod
    service on each server by issuing the following command:
    <code>
$ sudo systemctl restart mongod
    </code>
    With that, you’ve enabled replication for each server’s MongoDB instance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: At this point, you can use the <em class="highlight">nc</em> command to test whether the firewall rules you
    added in Step 2 are correct. nc, short for <em class="highlight">netcat</em>, is a utility used to establish network
    connections with TCP or
    UDP. It’s useful for testing in cases like this because it allows you to specify both an IP address and a port
    number when making a connection.
    <br>
    The following example nc command includes the <em class="highlight">-z</em> option, which limits the utility to only
    scan for a listening daemon on the target server without sending it any data. Recall from the prerequisite
    installation tutorial that MongoDB is running as a service daemon, making this option useful for testing
    connectivity. It also includes the <em class="highlight">v</em> option which increases the command’s verbosity,
    causing it to return more information than it would otherwise.
    <br>
    This example nc command shows an attempt to reach mongo1 from mongo0:
    <code>
$ nc -zv mongo1.replset.member 27017
    </code>
  </p>
  <h2 id="step-4">Step 4 — Starting the Replica Set and Adding Members</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you’ve configured each of your three MongoDB installations, you can open up a MongoDB shell to initiate
    replication and add each as a member.
    <br>
    For demonstration purposes, the examples in this step will use the MongoDB instance on mongo0 to initiate the
    replica set. However, you can initiate replication from any server whose mongod.conf file has been appropriately
    configured.

    <code>
      $ mongo
    </code>

    From the prompt, you can initiate a replica set from the mongo shell by running the <em
      class="highlight">rs.initiate()</em> method. However,
    running this method by itself would only initiate replication for the machine on which you run the method, and you’d
    then need to add your other Mongo instances by issuing an rs.add() method for each member.
    <br>
    Recall that MongoDB stores its data in JSON-like structures known as documents. Because you’ve already edited the
    mongod.conf file on each of your servers to configure the three Mongo instances for replication, you can instead
    include a document that holds each member’s configuration details within the rs.initiate method. This will allow you
    to start the replica set and add each member at once, rather than having to run multiple separate methods.
    <br>
    To do this, begin an rs.initiate() method by typing the following and pressing ENTER:
    <code>
  <pre>
> rs.initiate(
  {
    _id: "rs0",
    members: [
      {
        _id: 0,
        host: "mongo0.replset.member"
      },
      {
        _id: 1,
        host: "mongo1.replset.member"
      },
      {
        _id: 2,
        host: "mongo2.replset.member"
      }
    ]
  }
)
  </pre>
</code>
    Assuming that you entered all the details correctly, once you press ENTER after typing the closing parenthesis the
    method will run and initiate the replica set. If the method returns "ok" : 1 in the output, it means that the
    replica set was started correctly:

    <code>
  <pre>
{
  "ok" : 1,
  "$clusterTime" : {
      "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1612389071, 1),
      "signature" : {
          "hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
          "keyId" : NumberLong(0)
      }
  },
  "operationTime" : Timestamp(1612389071, 1)
}
  </pre>
</code>

    If the replica set was initiated as expected, you’ll notice that the MongoDB client’s prompt will change from just a
    greater-than sign (>) to the following:

    <code>
rs0:SECONDARY>
</code>
    OR
    <code>
rs0:PRIMARY>
</code>

  </p>

    <h3>
      Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
      Database replication has found wide use as a strategy to improve performance, availability, and data security, to
      the point where it’s recommended that any database used in a production environment has some form of replication
      enabled. Replicas are also versatile, and can take on many different roles in a data architecture, like reporting
      or
      disaster recovery. The automatic failover feature found in MongoDB’s replica sets make them particularly valuable
      for helping to ensure that your data remains highly available in the event of an outage.
